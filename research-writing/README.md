## Write your paper by playing a game

## The construction plan to write a paper

    1. Select a topic
    2. Read the literature
    3. (Experiment)
    4. Have an insight or conclusion
    5. Write it down

---

## Why the plan fails

---

## Clear topics are NOT given

Note:

- The topic emerges on the way
- Research topic is clear only in retrospect
- A topic emerges during the process of research
- A clear topic is not the beginning but one of the end results of research
- Clarity around the topic is a sign of the research being halfway through.

---

## Reading is NOT a linear absorption of knowledge 

Note:

- Reading is not linear
- Reading is not the absorption of material, it's not one-way from paper to brain. Reading is a conversation. Reading is not filling a blank slate with external thoughts. 
- Reading is about integrating new stuff to what you already have. How do you integrate a thought? You see how it challenges what you know. You see how it bridges a gaping hole of what you don't know.

---

## Insight is NOT one big Aha-moment

Note:

- A single, big, clear insight is rare. An insight usually lacks the specifics. It takes more small insights to have a paper. 

---

## Writing does NOT come after thinking

Note:
- Thinking doesn't take place in the mind
- Thinking takes place in writing and in conversation.

---

## Anxieties from planned writing

    - Blank page
    - Overwhelmed by criteria
    - Changing course
    - Interest conflicts with (assumed) expectations

---

## Planned vs emergent

## The collectible card game to write a paper

    - Collect cards
    - Build your deck
    - Select cards
    - Play with others
    - +1 Bonus

---

## Card types

    - Quick - what catches you
    - Permanent - what you build from
    - Project - what you share
    - References - what you refer to
    - Workflow - how you play the game

---

## Quick cards

    - The 5 second rule
    - One list
    - Idea, quote, observation, picture

---

## Read with a pen in hand

    - Rephrase, don't highlight
    - Handwrite, don't type
    - Save the reference
    - Follow your interest, don't care what seems important

---

## Permanent cards

    - Your second brain / second language
    - Thousands of cards
    - Rich connections
    - Shelf life of a thought

---

## Anatomy of a permanent card

    - Context
    - Crafted text
    - Why it matters
    - Title
    - Keywords and links

---

## Project cards

    - Temporary
    - Index and outline
    - Publication details

---

## Reference cards

    - Easy to revisit
    - Respect others

---

## Workflow cards

    - Personalize your system
    - Review your workflow after every session
    - Unstuck yourself

---

## Starter deck

    - Quick: empty
    - Permanent: empty
    - Project: empty
    - Workflow: 3 cards
    - References: 4 cards

---

## Workflow card 1: Processing quick cards

    1. Mark the first card
    2. Read the next cards and ask the same question
    3. What do I want to work on more than the last marked card?
    4. Mark that card
    5. Repeat the above three steps until you reach the end of the list
    6. Work on the marked cards (start with the last marked)
    7. You don't have to complete a card
    8. After work, move card to the end of the list

---

## Workflow card 2: Regular work

    - Process quick cards every day
    - Write a permanent card every day
    - Show a writing project every month

---

## Workflow card 3: Tools used

    - Physical index cards
    - Note-taking app: Dynalist
    - References: Zotero
    - Document writing: Markdown and Pandoc
