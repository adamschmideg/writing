## Write your paper by playing a game

## How you can do better

## The construction plan to write a paper

1. Select a topic
2. Read the literature
3. (Experiment)
4. Have an insight or conclusion
5. Write it down

---

## Why the plan fails

---

## Clear topics are NOT given

Note:

- The topic emerges on the way
- Research topic is clear only in retrospect
- A topic emerges during the process of research
- A clear topic is not the beginning but one of the end results of research
- Clarity around the topic is a sign of the research being halfway through.

---

## Reading is NOT a linear absorption of knowledge 

Note:

- Reading jumps from text to text
- Reading is not filling a blank slate with external thoughts. 
- Reading is a conversation. 
- Reading is about integrating new stuff to what you already have. How?
    - You see how it challenges what you know.
    - You see how it bridges a gaping hole of what you don't know.

---

## Insight is NOT one big Aha-moment

Note:

- A single, big, clear insight is rare.
- An insight usually lacks the specifics.
- It takes more small insights to have a paper. 

---

## Writing does NOT come after thinking

Note:
- Thinking doesn't take place in the mind
- Thinking takes place in writing and in conversation.

---

## Anxieties from planned writing

- Blank page
- Overwhelmed by criteria
- Changing course
- Interest conflicts with expectations

Note:

- Expectations may be real or assummed

---

## Planned vs emergent

---

## The collectible card game to write a paper

- Collect cards
- Build your deck
- Select cards
- Play with others
- +1 Bonus

---

## Card types

- Quick - what catches you
- Permanent - what you build from
- Project - what you share
- References - what you refer to
- Workflow - how you play the game

---

## Quick cards

- The 5 second rule
- One list
- Collect everything
- Idea, quote, observation, picture

---

## Read with a pen in hand

- Rephrase, don't highlight
- Handwrite, don't type
- Save the reference
- Follow your interest, not what seems important

---

## Permanent cards

- Your second brain / second language
- Thousands of cards
- Rich connections
- Shelf life of a thought

---

## Parts of a permanent card

- Context
- Crafted text
- Why it matters to you
- Title
- Keywords and links

---

## Project cards

- Temporary
- Index and outline
- Publication details

---

## Reference cards

- Easy to revisit
- Respect others

---

## Workflow cards

- Personalize your system
- Review your workflow after every session
- Unstuck yourself

---

## Starter deck

- Quick: empty
- Permanent: empty
- Project: empty
- Workflow: 4 cards
- References: 4 cards

---

## Workflow card 1: Processing quick cards
### Pre-selection

1. Mark the first card with X
2. Read the next cards and ask the same question:
3. What do I want to work on more than X?
4. Mark that card with X
5. Repeat it until you reach the end of the list

---

## Workflow card 2: Processing quick cards
### Working on cards

6. Work on the marked cards (start with the last marked)
7. You don't have to complete a card
8. After work, move card to the end of the list

---

## Workflow card 3: Regular work

- Process quick cards every day
- Write a permanent card every day
- Show a writing project every month

---

## Workflow card 4: Tools used

- Physical index cards
- Note-taking app: Dynalist
- References: Zotero
- Document writing: Markdown and Pandoc
